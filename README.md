# WindVisualization
COMP494hw2

## Emma Thole

## Parameters
  The parameters I chose to use in the end were a particle amount of 5000, a maximum lifetime of 100, and a step size of 1. These parameters seem to best visualize the wind data in the clearest way possible.
  
## Step Size
  A smaller step size creates a slower but more accurate trace of the vector field. Changing this to a larger step size causes a less accurate trace of the vector field because of compounding error with each step.
  
## Issues
  This is not entirely functional; there are some regions of the map that seem to be correct but there are some areas where particles get stuck moving in a perfectly straight vertical line, and also some areas where particles converge from multiple directions and become trapped. The right side of the window also does not show any particle data, and I can't figure out why. I spent time looking through my work and was not able to figure out where the error is, and ran into this problem later than I was able to ask you for help. Please let me know where my issue was so I can fix it for my own interest!
